/**
 * @defgroup    OS_LoggerOutput Log server backend interface
 *
 * @brief       Defined an generally class for log server backend
 *              implementation.
 *
 * @details     This is an definition of a class interface for concrete log
 *              server backend implementations.
 *
 *              A "OS_LoggerOutput_Handle_t" object provides the interface to a log
 *              server backend and at the same time is this object an observer.
 *
 *              Several observer can be assigned to one subject. To avoid the
 *              "malloc" function, objects of this type are defined externally.
 *
 *              To ensure that the observers are assigned to their subjects,
 *              they are assigned based on their nodes.
 *
 *              The auxiliary object OS_LoggerListT_t_Handle_t is also
 *              responsible for managing this nodes.
 *
 *              A log message should be printed on the log server backend.
 *              The handling of the format of the log is defined in the
 *              "OS_LoggerFormat_Handle_t" level.
 *
 *              This class is the consumer of the log formats and uses the log
 *              format only.
