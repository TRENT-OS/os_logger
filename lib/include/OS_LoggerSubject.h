/**
 * @defgroup    OS_LoggerSubject Log subject implemenation
 *
 * @brief       Derived class from class \link abstract_subject \endlink and
 *              provides an implemention for log subject.
 *
 * @details     This level provides an implementation for log subject.
 *              This class is derived by abstract subject.
 *
 *              Concrete observers can be registered to one subject by
 *              calling the "attach" function. Concrete observers can be
 *              deregistraded by calling "detach" function.
 *
 *              To inform the concrete observers by update, call the notify
 *              function.
 *
 *              The concrete implementation is realized as singleton. To one
 *              concrete subject can be registraded to different observers.
 *              There can exist different concrete subjects at the same time,
 *              but the assigning of a concrete observer is only allowed to one
 *              concrete subject at the same time. The assigned from one
 *              concrete observer to two different concrete subject leads
 *              to that the first assignee will be overwritten. And the concrete
 *              observer is assigned to the second (last - if more than two
 *              assigning issues has been done) concrete subject.
